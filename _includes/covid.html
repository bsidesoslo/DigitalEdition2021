		    <p class="large">Due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, and the restrictions in Oslo, it’s sadly becoming apparent that doing a BSides Oslo in the spring of 2021 won’t be possible either. As the organizers were discussing whether or not to postpone, we also had to decide when to postpone to. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to postpone the physical event to May 2022.</p>

		    <p class="large">We understand that this comes as a huge disappointment to the ticket holders, speakers, sponsors and everyone else in the community who've been looking forward to gathering at BSides Oslo in May 2021, and believe us when we say we’re just as disappointed. We’ve tried to identify every possible way we could still have the conference, but with restrictions being what they are, and wanting to have a safe and secure conference for everyone involved, there really was no way for us to have the conference.</p>

		    <p class="large">The community is and has always been the most important part of BSides Oslo, and none of this would be possible without your continued support. All ticket holders for BSides Oslo will be able to attend the 2022 conference. In addition we want to thank you for your continued support by making BSides Oslo 2021 digital.</p>

		    <p class="large">BSides Oslo Digital Edition will be on Tuesday the 8th of June and is free for our current ticket holders. The digital conference will contain several presentations, and the speakers will be selected and announced after our <a href="{{ site.forms.cfp }}">call for (digital) presenters</a>. As with our physical conferences, talks are recorded and shared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6kTOacrQTu1ahmRCvXhhrA">YouTube</a> for non-ticket holders some time after the event, but attendees will be able to attend live Q&#38;A sessions with the speakers. The event will also be MCed by the hosts of the security podcast <a href="https://twitter.com/5h3llcast">5h3llcast</a>.</p>

		<p class="large">We hope this comes as consolation for yet another delay. Your continued support means the world to us, and we will work tirelessly to make sure that when we finally gather in 2022, it’s going to be well worth the wait.</p>
