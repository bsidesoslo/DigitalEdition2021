Disinformation is a global threat that's become especially visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. As most countries struggle to contain a growing number of active cases, progress is undermined by false or misleading narratives about vaccines, masks, and conspiracy. In many places, protest and acts of civil disobedience erupted despite overwhelming scientific consensus on the safety of vaccines, the efficacy of masks, and the need for social distancing to mitigate the spread of the virus.

How is it that so many are influenced to make a global pandemic worse?

Looking at COVID-19 disinformation, we find that influence operations, from grassroots conspiracy theories to sophisticated state campaigns, utilize the same fundamental tactics, techniques, and procedures to achieve their desired outcome. These TTPs, modeled in the AMITT framework, help us understand the necessary individual steps needed to perform a successful influence operation.

In this talk, we'll introduce the AMITT framework for practical disinformation response and explore disinformation countermeasures that can be used to mitigate influence operations.
